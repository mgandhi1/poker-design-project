When you initialize our game, you will see several lines pop up in the console. 
These are the starting amounts, small and big blinds, and the players and their money. 
You start the first game with $1000 each. Our game is pass and play: When it is your turn, 
you will be able to see all the necessary information. 
You will see your name, your hand, your money, how much money you have bet that round, 
if you are allowed to check, and the call amount (minimum amount you need to bet to stay in the game), 
as well as the money and bets of all other players that are still in the game. 
You can choose the turn option of your choice (Call, Raise, Check, or Fold), 
and the amount, if raising. Subsequent players will execute their turns. At the end of 
each game, the game will evaluate 
and the last player standing wins the game. 

After opening the code, follow the directions in the "Poker_Tester" file.


Have fun!
